#NBCNewsApp

Goal
Build an iOS application that displays a News feed

Data
http://msgviewer.nbcnewstools.net:9207/v1/query/vertical/news/

This contains a JSON data feed of variety of news items, namely articles, videos and slideshows (which contain images arrays)

User Needs
	•	I’d like to be able to scan the headlines quickly
	•	I want visual variety
	◦	Because it looks good
	◦	Also when I click into a news item, I need know what I’m getting into.
	▪	I don’t want to click on a headline thinking I’m going to read an article, but accidentally start playing video (I HATE that)
	▪	Sometimes I feel like watching a video or viewing photos, and I want an obvious and enticing way to know what to tap on.
	•	I don’t want to see stale news

Technical Requirements
	•	Please implement this using Swift
	◦	We know you’re very adept with ObjC, but we also want to see you grow into new tech
	•	Show milestones in your progress using git
	◦	We know you’re solo on this project, but try to make not just readable code, but readable progress.  Everything dumped onto git as initial commit the day before you submit isn’t acceptable.

What we need from you, Conor
	1.	A timeline proposal

Let us know when you want to start, and a target date you’d like to submit.  

We are not inflexible, but you will be expected to show good estimation (and good communication skills if the estimations are off)


	2.	A git repo URL, with the completed project
